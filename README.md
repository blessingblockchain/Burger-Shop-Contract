# Burger-Shop-Contract

This is probably the most interesting project I have executed. This contract solves a real-life transactional issue of ordering burger and paying with crypto.

In this contract, the seller can receive order, send invoice, and also check orders.

On the other hand, the buyer can make orders and mark orders as delivered.

On this note, I must appreciate Ahmet. I learned how to do this project from his repo: https://github.com/ahmetozlu/the_smart_contract_burger_store/blob/fe5e559f1ec96c68e64549cc465c7dddb23b32b8/contracts/Burger.sol

## What I Learned

While building this contract, I noticed I no longer ask some questions I used to ask. Coding consistently has immersed me into understanding Solidity better over time.

I perfected my knowledge of contract logic, struct use and application, mapping use and application, and so many other things.

Again, I am not where I used to be. I'm getting better at this smart contract development thing and it has helped me to become a far better technical writer.
